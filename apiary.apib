# ACI Blog Index API
This API Provides an easy way to access all of the *Authoritative Content* available on ACI Blog Index via a simple RESTful API. In order to access the API, you must first request an Authentication Token.


# Group Authentication
Every request must be signed with an Authentication Token. This is done by adding an **Authorization** header to your request.

The Authorization header must contain the word "Token", Followed by the **Token ID**, and then by a **Token Signature**. 

## Token Signature
A **Token Signature** is a sha512 hash of your **Token Secret** concatenated with the current timestamp in UTC
formatted as `yyyyMMddHH`.

Please note that this signature must be within an hour of the current time, so you will need to regenerate your signature at least once every 60 minutes.


## Example Request
Given the following:

+ **Token ID**: `12345`
+ **Token Secret**: `MySuperSecretTokenSecret`
+ **Current UTC Time**: `10:00am August 26, 2014`

You would generate the UTC time format as: `2014082610`

Concatenate that with your token secret: `MySuperSecretTokenSecret2014082610`

Then create a sha512 Hash of that and get the hex digest: 
    `d406bcd846cf9ac4787bfb4bab65986db08cb4953066ccabe3abc88db8899cec2c63990d75ee7b617efa3d968a9689541f2834b41f221a1ae5411af785af89d8`

Your request would then include the authorization header:
    `Authorization: Token 12345 d406bcd846cf9ac4787bfb4bab65986db08cb4953066ccabe3abc88db8899cec2c63990d75ee7b617efa3d968a9689541f2834b41f221a1ae5411af785af89d8`

In a curl request:

    curl --header "Authorization: Token 12345 d406bcd846cf9ac4787bfb4bab65986db08cb4953066ccabe3abc88db8899cec2c63990d75ee7b617efa3d968a9689541f2834b41f221a1ae5411af785af89d8" "http://acindex.com/search?q=SomeQuery"
